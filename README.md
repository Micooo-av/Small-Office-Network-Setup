## Project Overview
A comprehensive Packet Tracer project demonstrating core networking concepts, including:  
- VLANs (Virtual Land Area Networks)  
- Inter-VLAN Routing  
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)   
- Wifi Setup

This project demonstrates the configuration of a **small office network** with VLANs, Inter-Vlan routing, DHCP, and basic Wi-Fi setup.  
The goal is to design and implement a simple yet functional network that supports multiple departments while ensuring segmentation and connectivity.

## Brief Description of the used concepts and the Roles they play in the network
1. **VLANs (Virtual land Area Networks)**
- **Purpose:** Segment a network into smaller, isolated segments (VLANs) to improve organization, security, and management.
- **Role:** VLANs act as separate networks, allowing devices within a VLAN to communicate with each other but not with devices in other VLANs without routing.

2. **Routing Configuration**
- **Purpose:** Enable communication between VLANs and other networks.
- **Role:** Routers connect multiple VLANs and networks, allowing devices to communicate with each other across different VLANs.

3. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Configuration**
- **Purpose:** Automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.
- **Role:** DHCP servers assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other network settings to devices, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## Tools used for this Lab
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Virtual Studio Code Terminal (for documentation editing)
